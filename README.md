# Core


An experimental layout engine based on Scribus code. 


## Goals

The first and main goal of this project is:

- Create a terminal only layout engine based on Scribus code that can read .SLA files and convert them to PDF.
- It should correctly compile on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows (with MingW)

Once this goal has been achieved, some other function are already planned:

- Enable scripting based on the new Scripter engine
- Export to .EPUB
- Join multiple .SLAs into one PDF.
